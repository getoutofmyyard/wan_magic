This is a lab that I made in my free time. See the topology diagram (topology.png) for more info.

Current configurations include:
  * Dual-hub DMVPN clouds for IPv4 and IPv6
  * Frame relay
  * PPPoE
  * Classic and named EIGRP, EIGROv6, OSPFv3, MP-BGP
  * IPv6 over IPv4 tunnels
  * DHCP relay for IPv4 and IPv6 (Stateful IPv6 DHCP requires a VM to test. VPCS only supports SLAAC.)
  * Route maps, prefix lists, route summarization, route filtering, ACLs
  * NAT
  * NetFlow
  * SNMP
  
 Upcoming configurations:
  * NAT64
  * Infrastructure ACLs
  * 6-to-4 tunnels
